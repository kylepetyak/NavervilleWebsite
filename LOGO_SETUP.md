# Logo Setup Guide

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Navigation Updated** - The logo is now fully integrated as a clickable home button!

## What's Been Done

1. **Logo Button Implemented**
   - Logo is now clickable and navigates to homepage
   - Hover effects with slight scale animation
   - Focus states for accessibility
   - Increased navbar height to h-20 for better logo visibility

2. **Placeholder Logo Created**
   - Location: `/public/logo.svg`
   - Simple medical cross icon with company name
   - This is just a temporary placeholder

3. **Fallback System**
   - If logo.svg doesn't load, automatically tries logo.png
   - Prevents broken images

## How to Add Your Real Logo

### Option 1: Replace the SVG (Recommended)

1. Get your logo in SVG format
2. Replace `/public/logo.svg` with your actual logo
3. Recommended dimensions: 240px wide x 50-60px tall
4. That's it! The navbar will automatically use it

### Option 2: Use PNG Format

1. Get your logo in PNG format (high resolution)
2. Save it as `/public/logo.png`
3. Delete `/public/logo.svg` (so the fallback triggers)
4. Recommended: 480px wide x 100-120px tall (2x for retina displays)

### Option 3: Use Both (Best)

1. Add `/public/logo.svg` for modern browsers
2. Add `/public/logo.png` as automatic fallback
3. Best cross-browser compatibility

## Logo Optimization Tips

### For SVG:
- Keep file size under 50KB
