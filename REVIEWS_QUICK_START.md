# Google Reviews Quick Start Guide

Since you already have a Google Business Profile with great reviews, here's how to integrate them into your website in **under 30 minutes**.

## Option 1: Manual Integration (5 Minutes) - RECOMMENDED

This is the fastest way to showcase your reviews. Your reviews are already configured!

### Step 1: Copy Your Reviews

1. Go to your [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com)
2. Click on "Reviews" in the left menu
3. Copy your top 8-10 best reviews (name, rating, text, date)

### Step 2: Update the Reviews File

Edit `/src/content/featured-reviews.json` and replace the placeholder reviews with your actual reviews:

```json
{
  "businessRating": {
    "averageRating": 4.9,  // ‚Üê Update with YOUR rating
    "totalReviews": 150    // ‚Üê Update with YOUR total
  },
  "featuredReviews": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "author": "Sarah M.",  // ‚Üê Replace with actual review
      "rating": 5,
      "date": "2 weeks ago",
      "text": "Your actual review text here...",
      "source": "Google",
      "verified": true
    }
    // Add 7-9 more reviews
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Get Your Review Link

1. Go to [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com)
2. Click "Get more reviews"
3. Copy the link (looks like: `https://g.page/r/xxxxx/review`)

### Step 4: Add to Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_REVIEW_LINK=https://g.page/r/YOUR_ACTUAL_LINK/review
```

### Step 5: Deploy

```bash
npm run dev  # Test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add real Google Business reviews"
git push
```

**Done!** Your reviews will show on the homepage automatically.

## Option 2: API Integration (30 Minutes) - For Advanced Users

This fetches reviews automatically from Google but requires API setup.

### Step 1: Get Your Place ID

**Method A: From Google Business URL**
1. Go to your Google Business Profile
2. Look at the URL: `business.google.com/n/123456789/`
3. That number is part of finding your Place ID

**Method B: Use Place ID Finder**
1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-placeid-finder
2. Search for "Camelback Medical Centers Naperville"
3. Copy the Place ID (starts with `ChIJ...`)

### Step 2: Get Google API Key

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project: "Naperville Website"
3. Enable "Places API"
4. Create API Key
5. Restrict it:
   - HTTP referrers: `*.camelbackmedical.com/*`
   - API restrictions: Places API only

### Step 3: Add to Environment

Add to `.env.local`:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=ChIJxxxxxxxxx
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxx
VITE_GOOGLE_REVIEW_LINK=https://g.page/r/xxxxx/review
```

Add same variables to Vercel:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add all 3 variables above

### Step 4: Create Review Fetcher Component

Create `/src/components/GoogleReviewsFetcher.tsx`:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function GoogleReviewsFetcher() {
  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);
  const placeId = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID;
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!placeId || !apiKey) return;

    const service = new google.maps.places.PlacesService(
      document.createElement('div')
    );

    service.getDetails(
      {
        placeId: placeId,
        fields: ['reviews', 'rating', 'user_ratings_total']
      },
      (place, status) => {
        if (status === 'OK' && place.reviews) {
          setReviews(place.reviews);
        }
      }
    );
  }, []);

  // Render reviews...
}
```
