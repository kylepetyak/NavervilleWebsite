## Blog System Overview

Your website uses a **JSON-based content management system** for blog posts. This means:

- ✅ No database required
- ✅ Version controlled (all changes tracked in Git)
- ✅ Fast performance (static generation)
- ✅ Easy to backup and restore
- ✅ SEO-optimized by default

**How It Works:**
1. Add blog posts to `/src/content/blog-posts.json`
2. Add blog images to `/public/images/blog/`
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Posts automatically appear on your blog

## Creating a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Plan Your Content

Before writing, identify:
- **Target Keyword**: Main search term (e.g., "back pain relief naperville")
- **Search Intent**: What users want (information, solution, comparison)
- **Target Audience**: Who you're writing for (patients, athletes, families)
- **Call to Action**: What you want readers to do (book appointment, call, read more)

### Step 2: Open Blog Posts File

Open `/src/content/blog-posts.json` in your code editor.

### Step 3: Add New Post Entry

Add your post to the `"posts"` array:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "your-post-slug",
      "title": "Your Full Post Title Here",
      "slug": "your-post-slug",
      "excerpt": "A compelling 150-160 character summary that entices readers...",

      },
      "seo": {

        "metaDescription": "Your compelling meta description that includes target keywords and CTA. 150-160 characters.",
        "keywords": ["keyword 1", "keyword 2", "keyword 3"],
        "canonicalUrl": "https://camelbackmedical.com/blog/your-post-slug"
      },
      "readTime": 8,
